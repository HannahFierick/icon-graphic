<p class="introtext"> Earlier this year, the MTA began phasing in the New R211 subway cars for service on the A train line. “Our commitment to providing the best and most reliable service to our customers is unwavering, and these state-of-the-art subway cars are proof of that,” said New York City Transit Senior Vice President for Subways Demetrius Crichlow. The R211 cars are set to replace the R46 cars that have been in service for the past 40 years. In June the MTA announced they would steadily begin adding 1-2 new cars into service a month. Here are the changes riders can expect to see when they step onto an R211. </p>

Wider Doorways: The doors on the R211 measure 58 inches compared to the 50 inches (the current MTA standard). This will help decrease station “dwell time” by an estimated 25-30%. The trains will also feature and open gangway design in which passengers will be able to safely travel between cars.

Updated Displays: There will be a digital display element in the R211 cars. The screens will display
digital advertisements, customer information displays and door-opening alerts among other capabilities. Some of the screens will also include touch screen technology and give passengers and interactive view of their route.

  Security cameras: Though riders won’t be able to see them, the new trains will have security cameras in each car. This is a first for the MTA agency which says that safety continues to be a top concern. There will be two cameras in every subway car.The cameras be record on a loop and law enforcement will have access to retrieve footage if needded.
